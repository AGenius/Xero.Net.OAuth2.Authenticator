# Xero.Net.OAuth2.Authenticator
Authenticate a connection to Xero using OAuth2. Retrieve your Access and Refresh tokens

Using this you can request an authenitcation with Xero using the new OAuth2 protocol.

Supports both PKCE and Code flows (Currently tested with PKCE Only)

An an external browser window will be opened to request the permissions required and will return the required tokens for further access.

You can also refresh the token using this code.

## Inspired By
My Xero..Net wrapper. I felt it might be usefull to have a standa alone oAuth2 token authentication process.

### Create a Xero App first 
You can follow these steps to create your Xero app to allow access to your Xero tenant(s)

* Create a free Xero user account (if you don't have one)
* Use this URL for beta access to oAuth2 [https://developer.xero.com/myapps](https://developer.xero.com/myapps)
* Click "New app" link
* Enter your App name, company url, privacy policy url, and redirect URI (this is your callback url - localhost, etc) I would suggest http://localhost:8888/callback/
* Choose PKCE
* Agree to terms and condition and click "Create App".
* Copy your client id and client secret and save for use later.
* Click the "Save" button. 

## Getting Started
Clone/Download the repository
To restore the packages used from NuGet and you may need to execute in the Nuget package console

``
Update-Package -reinstall
``

Setup the configuration : PKCE Example :-

```c#
##             // Setup New Config
            XeroConfig = new XeroConfiguration
            {
                ClientID = XeroClientID,
                CallbackUri = XeroCallbackUri,
                State = XeroState, // Optional - Not needed for a desktop app
                codeVerifier = null // Code verifier will be generated if empty
            };
            XeroConfig.AddScope(XeroScope.accounting_all_read);
            XeroConfig.StoreReceivedScope = true;
            SaveConfig();

            _auth2 = new Xero.Net.OAuth2.Authenticator.oAuth2(XeroConfig);
            _auth2.InitializeoAuth2();

            string accessToken = _auth2.ReturnedToken.AccessToken;
            string refreshToken = _auth2.ReturnedToken.RefreshToken;
            DateTime tokenExpires = _auth2.ReturnedToken.ExpiresAtUtc;

```

There is more information returned from the Auth process (e.g. Authorised Tenants collection). I would suggest saving the entire ReturnedToken object returned from the process

This can be re-loaded to the Config   XeroConfig..XeroApiToken

## Known Issues and Future Updates
* Currently the oAuth2 handles PKCE only. Not tested for Code flow just yet
* The State value used in the OAuth2 process is sent and received but is not checked for validity
